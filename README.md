## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is part of the requirements for the Data Scientist Nanodegree program at Udacity. 
For this project, I was interested in using GlassDoor data for DS/ML jobs to better understand:

1. What are the top industries hiring data professionals
2. What are the main tools used by data professionals 
3. Which data role has the highest salary

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a Jupyter Notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://tarahaddadin.medium.com/how-to-break-into-the-field-of-data-science-80eb8d8bd45e).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Data obtained from Kaggle.
